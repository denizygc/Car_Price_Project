# Car_Price_Project

#### This project has been prepared as a result of the Introduction to Data Science 101 training series received on Patika.dev.
The steps aimed and carried out in the project are as follows.
1) Downloading and reading the data you will use
2) To take care of the missing and categorical variables in your data and feed it to the model.
3) Deciding on the error metric based on the problem you are dealing with (like the RMSE-RMSLE we saw in the tutorial)
4) Splitting your data into train-validation-test.
5) Trying out as many models as possible and picking the one that does best in our metric.
